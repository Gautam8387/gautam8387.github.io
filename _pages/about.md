I am a PhD student at MIT, interested in building algorithms and systems to improve health and biology. My research interests include ML/AI, LLMs (and agents), signal processing, graph theory and representation, system design, and multimodal learning.

I graduated from Ashoka University in May 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics, followed by a Postgraduate Diploma in Advanced Studies and Research. My undergraduate thesis was titled “Agent-based Conversational Augmented Intelligence System for Probable Abdominal Pain Diagnosis in Outpatient Setting.”

My research experience is focused on AI in healthcare, health informatics, data standardization, and drug discovery. I have worked on projects involving the classification of medical images (CT, H&E, ANA), analysis of cough audio files for tuberculosis detection, and information extraction from unstructured clinical notes using large language models. I have also contributed to the development of a comprehensive Indian drug knowledge base and the application of hypergraphs for representing patient allergy data.

I am a strong believer in open-source and interdisciplinary collaboration. I have teaching experience as a Teaching Assistant and Fellow at Ashoka University, IIT Jodhpur, and Plaksha University, and I have given talks on computational thinking and machine learning to high school students.
